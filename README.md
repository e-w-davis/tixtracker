#Tix-Tracker

This app was created to give users a centralized location to store their memories of past and future concerts.

##Technologies Used

Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Django, postgreSQL, AWS, and Materialize

##Getting Started

[Click here](https://tixtracker.heroku.com) to go to the website. Click the menu button in the upper right-hand corner and select sign up. </br>
Then you can start adding the tix you have!

##Future Enhancements

I would like to add the field of status so users can check off if they've been to or are planning on going to the concert.
